# :snake: JavaScript Snake Game

## :sparkles: Description
Relive the nostalgia with this JavaScript Snake Game, a replica of the classic Nokia phone game. Guide the snake, grow its length, and avoid walls and obstacles. It's all the fun of the early cell phone era brought to modern browsers.

## :gear: Installation
No package installations required! Simply:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start playing!

## :video_game: Usage
Navigate to the opened `index.html` page in your web browser to start the game. Use the arrow keys to direct the snake towards the food and away from the walls and its own tail. Each piece of food the snake eats will make it grow longer and increase your score. How high can you go?
